			<p> This specialization revolves around the use of damage-over-time effects and the upkeep of each debuff. Affliction Warlock is a cloth wearing dps caster which focuses on defeating its enemies with a large selection of damage over time abilitys (or DoTs), and nukes that benefit greatly from those DoTs. As a warlock, affliction has access to one of the best defensive toolkits in the game, in addition to having some of the best consistent damage for spread targets amongst any of the classes in game.</p>

				<div class="subheading" id="h3"><h2>Destruction</h2></div>
			<p> This specialisation is, as the name suggests, focused on pure destructive power, with an arsenal of fire-focused spells.Destruction has always been known as a spec that excels at dealing large hits through  Chaos Bolt and very strong cleave damage through Havoc. Our primary resource is Soul Shards which we both generate and spend with a number of abilities in our kit. We can choose to either spend them on  Chaos Bolt which is a single target ability or  Rain of Fire with is an AoE ability that deals damage over time.We're known as the Warlock spec that deals its damage in big hits and doesn't rely on pets doing the dirty work for us. That's still the case to this very day, although we've become known for our signature cooldown  Summon Infernal making for a very strong companion when popped.</p>
